# Git Workflow Rules - Lovable Pattern

## Git Commit Workflow Pattern

When committing changes, follow this exact pattern used by Lovable:

### 1. Create Feature Branch
- Create a new branch from main for each feature/fix
- Branch name can be generic (e.g., "changes" or descriptive)

### 2. Make Changes and Commit
- Commit changes with message: `"Changes"`
- This is the working commit on the feature branch

### 3. Merge to Main with Descriptive Commit
- Merge the feature branch back to main
- Use a descriptive merge commit message with:
  - **Title**: Clear, concise description (e.g., "Fix pan offset in connections")
  - **Body**: Detailed explanation with bullet points describing:
    - What was changed
    - Why it was changed
    - How it works
  - **Metadata**: Include `X-Lovable-Edit-ID: <unique-id>` header (optional, for tracking)

### Example Merge Commit Format:
```
Fix pan offset in connections

Adjust ConnectionLines positioning to account for zoom/pan transforms by moving the overlay inside the transformed calendar container and syncing coordinates, so arrows stay aligned when dragging.

X-Lovable-Edit-ID: edt-4ebb4a07-b68f-481d-a885-c2499b5265f0
```

### When User Says "Follow Lovable Pattern" or "Commit with Lovable Pattern" or uses `/lovable-commit`:
1. Check current git status to see what files have changed
2. Analyze the changes to create an appropriate commit message
3. Create a feature branch if not on one (or use existing branch)
4. Stage and commit changes with message "Changes"
5. Merge to main with a descriptive merge commit that:
   - Has a clear title summarizing the changes
   - Includes detailed body explaining what/why/how
   - Lists key files/components affected
   - Optionally includes X-Lovable-Edit-ID header

### Cursor Command
Type `/lovable-commit` in the chat to trigger this workflow automatically.

### Alternative: Use Helper Script
You can also use the provided script: `./git-commit-lovable.sh "Title" "Description"`

### Commit Message Guidelines:
- **Title**: Use imperative mood, capitalize first letter, no period
- **Body**: Use bullet points for multiple changes, explain context
- **Be specific**: Describe what files/components were affected
- **Explain why**: Include reasoning for the change when relevant
